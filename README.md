### Additional features

**Transaction history​**  
Every transaction is permanently saved and can be viewed by the user.​

**Authorization​**  
A user can either be an admin or a client. As an admin you have additional rights to​
- see every user's data including balance and transaction history​
- make transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for other users​
- make other users become an admin, too​

The UI adapts depending on the users role and displays different sets of interactive buttons/inputs.​
​
**Separate data collections** for user data and for credentials as a safety feature.​

**Dark & light mode​**  
Users can choose between a light and a dark mode. The lastly applied mode is stored in a configuration file in the browser's local storage. This ensures that the selected mode is already applied before logging in.​

**Color scheme​**  
Each functionality has its unique color accent that is represented in the navigation bar and in each ​
corresponding card for easy navigation.
